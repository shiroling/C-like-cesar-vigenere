# C-like-cesar-vigenere
This is a C coded cesar and vigenere codage algorithim.
It' comming out of a work that we have to do at the IUT.
We are by group of 4, unless I think I'll do all the work but that's ok.

# ISSUES
### I first created a good algorithim for the cesar codage
but the issue is that we can't manage the accentuate characters (I'm in a french shool BTW).
So we have to find sometiong to deal with it.
We ask our C programming teacher who tell's us to read things about wchar_t type in C.
